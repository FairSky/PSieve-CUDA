    BOINCified, I think.
    
    Includes adding --device switch, renaming util->putil.
Date:   Thu Mar 11 15:33:26 2010 -0700
    Rearranged to keep GPU running.  Only partly tested.
Date:   Mon Mar 8 13:00:31 2010 -0700
    Minor text file changes (including poetry!)
Date:   Sun Mar 7 18:07:31 2010 -0700
    Better ffsll, text file cleanup
    
    - Discovered that ffsll is not atomic!  So I made a version better
      suited to this app, and it's faster too!
    - Cleaned up some text files.  README is now GPU-specific, and
      CHANGES.txt will now be auto-created from this git log.

    Saved a register on shiftmod; fixed memory check.
Date:   Sat Mar 6 10:43:32 2010 -0700
    Fixed CPU N check length, memory allocation.
Date:   Fri Mar 5 18:05:54 2010 -0700
    Working version with Montgomery REDC math.  Faster!
Date:   Fri Feb 26 23:02:29 2010 -0700
    Deleted old main versions.
Date:   Fri Feb 26 11:21:09 2010 -0700
    Fixed scripts; beta version
Date:   Fri Feb 26 10:56:01 2010 -0700
    Gitignore for ppsieve.
Date:   Fri Feb 26 10:27:22 2010 -0700
    cuda_sleep_memcpy, tried multiple build options
    
    - Added cuda_sleep_memcpy, which tries to minimize processor usage for
      predictable kernels.
    - Added multiple builds with different -D options.  Mainly for testing;
      I'll probably narrow them soon.

    Rearranged for parallel GPU/CPU processing
    
    Now immediately uploads P's to the GPU; then calculates K's on
    the CPU, presumably while the bit tables are being calculated on
    the GPU; then finally uploads K's and runs the main GPU kernel.

    Allowed 24 or 64-bit tables, depending on #define
    
    24-bit may be more useful for ATI, and might yet be faster on a
    real GPU; but 64-bit seems faster in the emulator.
Date:   Wed Feb 24 17:49:05 2010 -0700
    Rearranged memory access to coalesce.
Date:   Wed Feb 24 10:06:17 2010 -0700
    64-bit register lookup working.  Fast in emulator.
Date:   Mon Feb 22 10:38:00 2010 -0700
    Fixed cthread_count for regs used.
Date:   Sun Feb 21 17:46:40 2010 -0700
    Finished register lookup method. Fast in emulator.
Date:   Sun Feb 21 12:12:49 2010 -0700
    Untested register lookup code; could be too slow.
Date:   Sat Feb 20 17:45:04 2010 -0700
    Fixed appcu to find GPUs; make-zips to find appcu.cu.
Date:   Sat Feb 20 11:59:04 2010 -0700
    Initial (slow) version of ppsieve-cuda 2/20/2010
